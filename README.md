Powers Paymentology's Tech Radar at https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?documentId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPaymentology%2Ftech-radar%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fdata.json.

The rings are:
- Adopt. Things that we think you should seriously consider using.
- Trial. Things we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. 
- Assess. Things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet â€” unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you.
- Hold. Proceed with caution. 

In order to propose changes/additions, please submit a PR directly on the repository and contact your Engineering Manager to attend the next available AWG meeting to present on it.
